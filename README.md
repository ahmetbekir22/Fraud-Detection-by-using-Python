Fraud Detection in Presidential Election of USA in 2012

This Python project is dedicated to the in-depth analysis of the 2012 US Presidential Election data. 
By visualizing the vote counts, percentages, and examining the distribution of least significant digits,
this project aims to determine the integrity of the election results. Using a variety of statistical tools and visualizations,
it offers valuable insights into the election's fairness and accuracy. 
覺 have also add some sample image of graphics.

Some information about libraries:
覺 used numpy and pandas library to manipulate data.
覺 used sys library because it allows the script to take input parameters, such as the filename and list of nominees, directly from the command line when it's executed.
覺 used matplotlib for creating various types of plots and graphs to visualize and analyze the election data, making the results more accessible and informative.

to execute code here is sample command:
python main.py ElectionUSA2012.csv Obama Romnay Johnson Stein
Thanks to dynamic code even we chahge the order of names code will work properly.
